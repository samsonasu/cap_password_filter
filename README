Pretty simple gem that just replaces http authentication passwords (http://user:pass@host) with 'xxx.'   This is useful if you have a mercurial repo behind http authentication and you don't want your password spalyed all over your terminal every time you deploy. 


To use just install the gem (duh) and require it your deploy.rb: 

require 'cap_password_filter'


That's it.  This only filters those http auth password, but if you notice any other kinds that should be filtered too, let me know or write a patch.
